# Transport Repository

Welcome to the **Transport** repository — a personal knowledge base and development lab focused on exploring and applying data-driven methods in transportation, urban systems, and geospatial analytics.

---

## Purpose

This repository serves as a central hub for:

- Transport system modeling  
- Urban planning and infrastructure research  
- Geospatial and spatial analysis  
- Data visualization of mobility and flow patterns  
- Tools and experiments in transportation engineering

All content reflects a mix of personal learning, practical exploration, and real-world insight.

## 4-Step Transport Planning Model

Key focus areas include the classic four-step modeling approach:

1. **Trip Generation** – Understanding how many trips originate and end in different zones  
2. **Trip Distribution** – Modeling travel patterns between origin-destination pairs  
3. **Mode Choice** – Evaluating how users select between transport modes  
4. **Route Assignment** – Simulating how trips are distributed across a network

## Spatial & Flow Analysis

Using Python, SQL, and GIS tools, this repo explores:

- Heatmaps and animated traffic flows  
- OD matrices and congestion maps  
- Geospatial clustering of land use and accessibility  
- Demand vs. capacity mapping for strategic planning
